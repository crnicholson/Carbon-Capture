# Materials

## Prerequisites

To understand or replicate parts of this project, you should have the following skills and knowledge:

1. Basic Arduino coding and wiring
2. Familiarity with the Arduino Serial Monitor
3. Proficiency with tools such as drills and hot glue guns
4. Experience with simple data analysis tools (e.g., Google Sheets or Excel)
5. A basic understanding of:
   * Airtight sealing
   * Basic/intermediate-level chemistry and physics
   * Common sense (I admit, I’m lacking some of that myself)

The estimated cost of this is $150 (only for the materials, not the tools), but if you tinker a lot then you probably have some of this on hand.

Here are some chemicals you're going to need throughout this journey:

* Sodium carbonate (50g)
* Distilled or deionized water (1L)
* Ion exchange resin (this might not be the perfect one, I'll keep you posted): [https://dws.octochemstore.com/product/amberlite-ira900-cl/](https://dws.octochemstore.com/product/amberlite-ira900-cl/)

Here are some generic items and some materials you'll need:

* IP67 waterproof box
* Small, geared DC motor
* Fishing line (or something similar to hold the resin when it is lowered into the water by the motor)
* Something to hold the resin in, like a fine nut milk bag or non-woven polyester. This would also work: [https://www.amazon.com/Shappy-Aquarium-Drawstring-Activated-Saltwater/dp/B096BD66NM/ref=sr\_1\_23?crid=24X47J3R287JA\&keywords=0.1mm+mesh+bag\&qid=1693741321\&sprefix=0.1mm+mesh+bag%2Caps%2C104\&sr=8-23](https://www.amazon.com/Shappy-Aquarium-Drawstring-Activated-Saltwater/dp/B096BD66NM/ref=sr_1_23?crid=24X47J3R287JA\&keywords=0.1mm+mesh+bag\&qid=1693741321\&sprefix=0.1mm+mesh+bag%2Caps%2C104\&sr=8-23#customerReviews)
* Arduino Uno
* USB cable for Uno
* SCD30 CO₂ sensor
* Wires for sensor
* Something large enough to hold enough water (\~50mL) of water that the resin is lowered into
* I2C logic level shifter (not needed if using Adafruit breakout)
* Some sort of tape, whether it's packaging or electrical or somehting else entirely

Here are some tools and equipment needed:

* Hot glue gun with glue
* Drill with bits
* Super accurate scale (0.01g resolution scales are only $20)
* Slow cooker (I got mine at my library for free for three weeks). Of course, if you're in a real lab, a hot plate would be better, but I'm just making doing with what I have available.
* Set of small beakers (100-250mL)
* Pair of nitrile gloves (for handling resin and carbonate)
* Safety goggles (for the carbonate)
* Easily cleanable workspace, such as a baking sheet or pan. Things will get messy!
* Scooping or measuring spoon (a popsicle stick works just fine)
* Stirring stick (I used a popsicle stick, but a glass rod would be ideal)
