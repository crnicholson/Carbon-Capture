# Before You Start...

There are a few things you should do before you go to any other sections (assuming you've read the main title page). It is highly suggested that you pick a few of these links to check out. If you're short of time, I suggest the interactive or the video. These will help you understand the need for CDR and clear confusion between the distinct types.

1. A long but informational article: [https://cdrprimer.org/read](https://cdrprimer.org/read)
2. Check this fact sheet out: [https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-FactSheet.pdf](https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/Carbon-Dioxide-Removal-FactSheet.pdf)
3. Fun little interactive animation of moisture swing carbon capture: [https://openaircollective.cc/what-is-dacc/](https://openaircollective.cc/what-is-dacc/)
4. Ten-minute video clearing confusion on everything CDR (carbon dioxide removal): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wT10LDwe64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wT10LDwe64)

This is a very incomplete "guide". It focuses just on moisture swing absorption and not anything else, so it might be a bit biased.&#x20;

To follow this tutorial on how to create your own moisture swing system, please start out by thoroughly reading the links on this page and the main "Carbon Capture" page.&#x20;

After that, go read the test chamber pages, the sorbent prep pages, and the materials page to know what you're going to get into. It is a lot of work and does take some dedication to create your own machine.
