# Test Chamber MK1  

I’m including this for two reasons:  
1. **Science** says you should document everything.  
2. To explain why MK2 exists—because MK1 is, frankly, a disaster.  

## A Lesson in What Not to Do  

**This setup is a mess. Spare yourself the pain and don’t replicate it.**  

For this version, I used an **Ikea box** paired with a **MOX sensor**. Let me save you some trouble: MOX sensors are absolute garbage. Even the $30 pre-calibrated one from Adafruit (yes, I splurged) was laughably inaccurate.  

### What I Did:  
1. Wired everything according to Adafruit’s guidelines.  
2. Added tubing for a syringe.  
3. Installed a fan powered by a DC variable power supply to circulate air.  
4. Tried to hermetically seal the box with aluminum (duct) tape over all the seams.  

**Spoiler alert:** It didn’t work.  

### Key Takeaways:  

1. **MOX Sensors Are Bad:**  
   MOX sensors are notoriously unreliable for measuring CO₂. Their readings are all over the place, making them unsuitable for precise testing.  

2. **Fans Mess with Sensors:**  
   The fan I added to circulate air inside the chamber ended up skewing the CO₂ readings. It increased the airflow across the sensor, making it falsely detect higher CO₂ concentrations. This theory needs further testing with more advanced sensors, but for now, consider it a lesson learned.
