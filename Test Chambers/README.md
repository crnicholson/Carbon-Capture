# Test Chambers

This document details the test chambers I’ve designed. These chambers are essentially small, hermetically sealed (air-tight) boxes used to test the desorption performance of the sorbent material—specifically, ion exchange resin in this case.

While you don’t need to replicate my setup exactly, I recommend referring to the MK2 and MK3 guides if you’re looking to create your own test chamber. They provide a solid starting point for designing and building your system.
