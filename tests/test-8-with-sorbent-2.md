# Test #8 with Sorbent #2

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>)

Notes: A very minor success. I decided to make a new sorbent material to see if that would increase my capture rate, but unfortunately it didn't work too well. It should be noted that the resin bag fell into the water at some point, and I knew it has fell in by 17:30, though it probably fell in at around 17:00. I decided to keep it in the water just to see what would happen, and it did rise ever so slightly.

Time water added: 3:35

Time water taken away: 3:37

Start ppm: 1387

End ppm: 1520

Rise ppm: 133

Total time frame: 4 hr 35 min

Experiment time frame: 4 hr 18 min (starting when I added water)

Test chamber: MK3
