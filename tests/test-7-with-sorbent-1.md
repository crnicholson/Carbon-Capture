Notes: A big failure. The ppm didn't even change when I added water! I really don't know what happened here. I guess it's time to rethink this!

Time water added: 7:03

Time water taken away: 7:05

Start ppm: 1002

End ppm: 995

Rise ppm: -7

Total time frame: 1 hr 16 min

Experiment time frame: 1 hr 6 min (starting when I added water)

Test chamber: MK3
