# Test #5 with Sorbent #1

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png>)

Notes: My third success! The ppm changed when I lowered it into the water, albeit it took some time. The weird spikes caused earlier on are probably from sensor error. Overall, I would label this a minor success because it did take some time to gain CO2 concentration. I also think my sensor was uncalibrated because the readings were pretty far off from what they should be, seeing as I subjected the chamber with air supplied from indoor air, which has levels of 1000-1500 ppm. This doesn't mean that the sensor can't sense an increase in CO2, though, so I would still label this a success.&#x20;

Time water added: 8:30

Time water taken away: 8:32

Start ppm: 417

End ppm: 540

Rise ppm: 123

Total time frame: 4 hr 29 min (holy cow!)

Experiment time frame: 4 hr 26 min (I started it a little too early)

Test chamber: MK3
