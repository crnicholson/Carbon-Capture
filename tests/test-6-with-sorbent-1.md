# Test #6 with Sorbent #1

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png>)

Notes: A big failure. The ppm barely changed when I added water. I used a tea bag to hold the resin in the lowering and raising system, and it fell off at some time and broke, and I didn't notice. I suspect it fell off early on (in the first quarter).

Time water added: 1:11

Time water taken away: 1:13

Start ppm: 992

End ppm: 1006

Rise ppm: 14

Total time frame: 1 hr 35 min

Experiment time frame: 1 hr 29 min (starting when I added water)

Test chamber: MK3
