# Sorbent #2 Preparation  

**Note:** This is an improved version of the **Sorbent #1 Prep**, now incorporating a crucial **rinsing step** for better results.  

**Second Note:** For optimal carbon capture, hydroxide ions are preferable because they can capture **twice the amount of CO₂** compared to carbonate ions. However, for safety and accessibility in a kitchen setting, I am using **sodium carbonate** instead of the highly alkaline sodium hydroxide. If you have proper safety gear and experience handling strong chemicals, you can substitute with a **1.0 M sodium hydroxide solution** for this process.  

## Why Prep the Sorbent?  

Factory-fresh ion exchange resin isn’t ready for carbon capture—it arrives loaded with chloride ions bound to its quaternary ammonium functional groups. To make the resin CO₂-absorbent, we need to replace the chloride ions with **carbonate** or **hydroxide ions** via multiple chemical baths.  

## Process Overview  

### Steps at a Glance:  
1. **Pore Opening:** Soak the resin in hot water for 48 hours.  
2. **Ion Exchange:** Submerge the resin in a sodium carbonate solution for 2 hours, rinse thoroughly, and repeat the bath-and-rinse cycle **6-7 times**.  
3. **Drying:** Allow the resin to dry for 24 hours before testing.  

## Step 1: Materials  

### Chemicals  
- **Sodium carbonate** (at least 15g; use ~2.15g per wash). Avoid sodium bicarbonate.  
- **Distilled or deionized water** (minimum 1 liter; 300mL is required for the baths, with extra as backup).  

### Sorbent Resin  
- **Amberlite IRA900 Cl** or equivalent ion exchange resin: [Product Link](https://dws.octochemstore.com/product/amberlite-ira900-cl/).  

## Step 2: Supplies and Tools  

- **High-resolution scale** (for precise measurements).  
- **Beakers** (or heat-resistant containers).  
- **Stirring implement** (e.g., popsicle stick).  
- **Measuring tools** (for water and solution preparation).  
- **Safety gear:** Goggles and gloves (for handling sodium carbonate and resin).  
- **Resin bag:** Use a nut milk bag, resin-specific bag, or non-woven polyester. The bag must allow water to pass through while containing the tiny resin beads.  
- **Heating device:** Slow cooker or lab-grade hotplate.  
- **Work surface:** A cookie sheet or similar containment area.  

## Step 3: Procedure  

1. **Prepare the resin:**  
   - Weigh **5 grams** of resin and place it into the resin bag.  
   - Fill a beaker with distilled water and submerge the resin bag.  
   - Place the beaker into a slow cooker filled with water, ensuring the beaker is fully surrounded.  

2. **Heat the resin:**  
   - Set the slow cooker to **low** (maintaining ~85°C).  
   - Allow the resin to soak for **48 hours** to open its pores.  

3. **Prepare the sodium carbonate solution:**  
   - Near the end of the 48-hour soaking period, dissolve **2.15g of sodium carbonate** in **50mL of distilled water** to create a **0.5 M solution**.  
   - (Optional: Prepare a larger batch to minimize the number of solutions you need to mix.)  

4. **Chemical bath and rinsing cycle:**  
   - After 48 hours, remove the resin bag from the water and rinse it thoroughly with distilled water.  
   - Immediately place the rinsed bag into the prepared sodium carbonate solution.  
   - After **2 hours**, remove the bag, rinse it thoroughly, and discard the used solution.  
   - Prepare a fresh sodium carbonate solution and repeat the bath-and-rinse cycle.  
   - Repeat this step **6-7 times** to ensure complete ion exchange (chloride → carbonate).  

5. **Dry the resin:**  
   - After the final rinse, allow the resin bag to dry for **24 hours** before testing.  

6. **Optional Pre-Saturation:**  
   - Run a fan over the dried resin to pre-saturate it with CO₂ before testing.  

## Step 4: Celebrate!  

Congratulations! You’ve successfully prepared a CO₂-absorbing sorbent. It’s now ready to be placed into a test chamber for evaluation.  

## Lessons Learned and Future Improvements  

After initial testing (see **Tests** section), I identified a few areas for improvement:  

1. **Lack of Agitation:**  
   - The study I referenced utilized a magnetic stirrer to agitate the resin during the chemical bath. I don’t currently own one, which might have affected the results. Magnetic stirrers cost ~$100 on the lower end, so this project will be paused until I can acquire one.  

2. **Alternative Chemicals:**  
   - Sodium carbonate might not be as effective as sodium hydroxide for ion exchange. According to [this discussion](https://www.openairforum.org/t/potential-alternative-salts/67/3), hydroxide-based solutions could yield significantly better results.  

3. **Concentration of Solution:**  
   - I used a **0.5 M sodium carbonate solution**, but increasing the concentration to **1.0 M** might improve the resin’s performance.  

4. **Quality of Ion Exchange Resin:**  
   - I was unable to obtain the specific resin used in the study and opted for a budget-friendly alternative. This might be another factor in the suboptimal results.  

5. **Loss of Resin:**  
   - My current resin containment system led to significant loss—approximately 75% of the resin. A better containment method is needed to minimize waste.  

By refining these steps, I aim to improve the sorbent’s efficiency in future experiments. For now, I’ll continue documenting the process and sharing findings to build on this work.
