# Sorbent #1 Preparation  

**Note:** This method is a **"what not to do"** guide. I recommend following the **Sorbent #2 Preparation** steps instead. This is purely here for documentation and to show an example of what doesn’t work well.  

**Second Note:** For optimal carbon capture, hydroxide ions are more effective than carbonate ions, as they can absorb twice the amount of CO₂. However, I opted for **sodium carbonate** (a safer alternative to sodium hydroxide) since I’m working in a kitchen. If you have the proper safety equipment and experience to handle strong alkalis, feel free to substitute sodium carbonate with a 1.0 M sodium hydroxide solution in this process.

## Why Prep the Sorbent?  
Ion exchange resin isn’t ready for carbon capture straight out of the factory. The chloride ions attached to the resin’s quaternary ammonium functional groups must be replaced with either **carbonate ions** or **hydroxide ions**. This is done by soaking the resin in a chemical bath.  

## Process Summary:  
1. **Open the resin’s pores:** Soak the resin in hot water for 48 hours.  
2. **Chemical baths:** Immerse the resin in a sodium carbonate solution for 2 hours, then replace the solution and repeat the process 5-6 times.  
3. **Dry:** Allow the resin to dry for 24 hours before testing.  

## Step 1: Materials Needed  

### Chemicals:  
- **Sodium carbonate** (minimum 15g; you’ll need ~2.15g per wash). Avoid sodium bicarbonate.  
- **Distilled or deionized water** (at least 1 liter, but 300mL is the minimum for 6 washes).  

### Sorbent Resin:  
- **Amberlite IRA900 Cl** (or equivalent ion exchange resin): [Product Link](https://dws.octochemstore.com/product/amberlite-ira900-cl/).  

## Step 2: Tools & Supplies  

- **High-resolution scale**  
- **Beakers**  
- **Stirring tool** (e.g., popsicle stick)  
- **Measuring tools**  
- **Safety equipment:** Goggles and gloves (sodium carbonate can irritate skin).  
- **Resin bag:** Use a nut milk bag, resin-specific bag, or non-woven polyester to contain the resin beads.  
- **Heating device:** Slow cooker or lab hotplate.  
- **Work surface:** A tray or cookie sheet for containment.  

## Step 3: Procedure  

1. **Prepare the resin:**  
   - Place **5 grams** of resin into the resin bag.  
   - Fill a small beaker with distilled water and submerge the resin bag.  
   - Place the beaker into a slow cooker filled with water, ensuring the beaker is fully submerged.  
2. **Heat the resin:**  
   - Turn the slow cooker to **low** (maintain ~85°C).  
   - Let the resin soak for **48 hours** to open the pores.  
3. **Prepare the sodium carbonate solution:**  
   - Near the 48-hour mark, dissolve **2.15g of sodium carbonate** in **50mL of distilled water** to create a **0.5 M solution**.  
   - (Optional: Create a larger batch if you prefer fewer solution changes.)  
4. **Chemical bath cycle:**  
   - After 48 hours, remove the resin bag from the water and immediately place it into the sodium carbonate solution.  
   - After **2 hours**, discard the solution and prepare a fresh batch.  
   - Repeat this process **6-7 times** to ensure complete ion exchange (chloride → carbonate).  
5. **Dry the resin:**  
   - Remove the resin bag and allow it to dry for **24 hours** before testing.  
6. **Optional CO₂ saturation:**  
   - Before testing, run a fan over the dried resin to pre-saturate it with CO₂.  

## Step 4: Celebrate!  

Congratulations! You’ve successfully prepped a CO₂-absorbing sorbent. Place it into a test chamber to evaluate its performance.  

## Lessons Learned  

After my initial tests (see **Tests** section), the results were underwhelming. Upon re-reading the study, I realized I’d made a critical mistake: **I didn’t rinse the resin after each wash.** Future attempts will include rinsing the resin thoroughly after every chemical bath to ensure better performance.
