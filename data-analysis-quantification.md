# Data Analysis/Quantification

To create graphs from the CO2 sensor, follow this simple guide that I made on GitHub: [https://github.com/charlienicholson3/scd30Code/tree/main](https://github.com/charlienicholson3/scd30Code/tree/main).

To learn how much carbon dioxide you captured, go to this guide on GitHub: [https://github.com/charlienicholson3/Carbon-Capture-Calculator](https://github.com/charlienicholson3/Carbon-Capture-Calculator).

(And yes, I know that I should make the above two resources into one mega spreadsheet, but I don't have the time. If someone does, make a pull request on the GitHub page).
