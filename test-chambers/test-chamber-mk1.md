# Test Chamber MK1

I'm only mentioning this because (1 science says that I should document everything and (2 so you know why MK2 exists and it isn't just MK1.&#x20;

## This is a piece of crap. Please don't do this to yourself.

I used an Ikea box with a MOX sensor. MOX sensors are actually legit garbage mixed with flaming poop. Never use them. They are so inaccurate, even if you break the bank and buy a $30 Adafruit one, which is pre-calibrated.&#x20;

I wired up everything according to Adafruit and added some tubing for a syringe. Then, I put a fan in the box, powered by DC variable power supply. Finally, I put aluminum tape (duct tape) over all the edges/seams/whatever-you-call-it to supposedly hermetically (to make something airtight) seal it. Yeah, let's just say that didn't work.&#x20;

The one thing I did learn from this test is that the fan to circulate everything messes up the readings, because it blows more air (with more CO2) across the sensor, making it think that there is more CO2 in the box than there actually is. Though I still have to test this theory again with more advanced sensors.&#x20;

Here are some pictures of you really want to see my ugly monstrosity:
