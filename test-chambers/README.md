# Test Chambers

Here is my documentation for the test chambers. The test chambers are basically little hermetically (air-tight) sealed boxes that we can test the desorbtion of the sorbent material, in this case ion exchange resin. Feel free to freestyle this if you want, you don't need to follow my guide exactly, but it is easier to do that, as I have it mostly layed out.&#x20;
