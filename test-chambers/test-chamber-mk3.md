# Test Chamber MK3  

**But wait... there’s more!**  

After some suboptimal results in my earlier tests, I revisited the study and realized that achieving better outcomes required removing the resin **exactly 2 minutes after initial wetting**. To automate this process, I created a simple mechanism using:  
- A **geared DC motor**  
- A **3D-printed string winder**  
- Fishing line  
- A packet of resin  

Here’s how it works:  
- The motor turns the winder, pulling up the fishing line and raising the resin packet out of the water.  
- By reversing the motor’s polarity, it spins in the opposite direction, unwinding the line and lowering the resin back into the water.  

To integrate this mechanism with the MK2 chamber:  
1. I hot-glued the motor assembly to the lid of the chamber.  
2. Drilled a hole in the lid for the motor’s wires.  
3. Sealed the hole where the syringe had been, as it was no longer needed for this design.  

This upgrade streamlined the process and allowed for more precise timing, making the system much more reliable for future tests.
